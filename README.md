## Project Goal :round_pushpin: :

Using a dataset of songs that appeared in the Billboard TOP 100, the goal was to classify the songs as belonging to the Rap genre or not. To achieve this, musical characteristics of the Rap genre obtained from the dataset were utilized.

### Note about the files :exclamation: : 

This repository contains:
- The dataset (`"Hot_100_Audio_Features_completo"`);
- The classifier (`"Projeto_2_CDADOS.ipynb"`);

Additionally, there are files generated by the project, which consist of:

- A file generated by the program showing a decision tree of the classifier, which was transformed into an image (`"Decision_tree_random.png"`) using an online converter to display in the classifier's detail;
- Two images of tables that were used in the descriptive part of the project.


### ote about the participants [Information for evaluative purposes of the project - 2nd Semester of Computer Engineering]:

All participants in the project attended the meetings both during class hours and outside of them, including weekends, to complete the work. We chose not to commit separately as we faced issues with 'git', which sometimes rejected the 'commit', claiming there were problems importing the files.

The entire project was conducted in online meetings via 'Microsoft Teams' and received assistance from the instructors of the "Data Science" course: Maria Kelly Venezuela and Bárbara Agena.
